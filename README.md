Train Delay Prediction

About the project

Train delays can have a significant impact on passengers and logistics. 
This project uses machine learning models to predict whether a train will be delayed and by how much, based on various input features.
The goal is to help authorities plan better and inform passengers ahead of time.

Predict train delays based on various factors such as weather, location, time of day, and historical performance using machine learning techniques.
